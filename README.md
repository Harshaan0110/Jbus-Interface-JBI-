## ðŸ“˜ Project Description
The **JBus Interface (JBI)** project is a complex physical design implementation done using **14nm technology**, integrating a large number of macros (**84**) and operating with two clock domains:
- `cmp_gclk` at **1.1 GHz**  
- `jbus_gclk` at **0.9 GHz**  

The design reflects extensive multi-clock domain handling, aggressive skew and uncertainty optimization, and clean STA closure across all phases. This project highlights strong control over physical constraints, timing budget distribution, and congestion management.

## ðŸ›  Flow Steps

### 1. RTL Synthesis (Design Compiler)
- Synthesized using 10K base standard cells  
- Clock constraints: `cmp_gclk = 1.1 GHz`, `jbus_gclk = 0.9 GHz`
- Transition time:  
  - **Data = T/3**  
  - **Clock = T/6**  
- Max fanout limited to **16**
- Setup Uncertainty:  
  - **30% of clock** applied in synthesis  
- Hold Uncertainty:  
  - **20% of clock**

### 2. Floorplanning (ICC2)
- **84 macros** integrated  
- **50% core utilization**  
- Aspect Ratio: **1.0** (square)  
- IO placement from **left to right**
- Die area: **146770.71 mmÂ²**
- Density: **21.24%**

### 3. Power Planning
- Power stripes and rings inserted based on macro proximity
- Voltage drop analysis ensured reliable power delivery

### 4. Placement
- Cells placed with congestion-aware optimization
- **Horizontal Congestion**: 0.79 (limit â‰¤ 1)  
- **Vertical Congestion**: 0.71 (limit â‰¤ 1)
- Final cell count: **35,703**

### 5. Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
- NDR applied:  
  - **2x spacing**  
  - **3x width**
- Clock buffers/inverters used: **BUF/INV {4, 6, 8, 10, 12}**
- **Insertion Delay**: 400ps  
- **Target Skew**: 50ps
- Setup uncertainty: **20% of clk**  
- Hold uncertainty: **20% of clk**

### 6. Routing
- Global and detailed routing completed
- Clean DRC  
- No shorts or opens

### 7. Static Timing Analysis (PrimeTime)
- Global timing met in `pt_shell` for both **setup and hold**
- **0 slack, 0 violations** post-route
